	<small>21 May&ndash;23 May, 2025.</small> Mini-workshop and start of the programme:
	“Recent developments in the model theory of fields”
	<p>This event will kick off the intensive period.</p>
      </summary>
      <p>The scientific area of this mini-workshop is recent developments in the model
	theory of fields. The aim is to introduce the participants to some of the latest scientific developments in the area. The workshop targets PhD students
	and young researchers, and will consist of 10 research talks by leading experts in the field, as well as some opportunities for early career researchers
	to present posters and give contributed talks. Each research talk will be of
	1 hour duration (including questions).
	The number of participants is expected to be around 50.</p>

	<small>23 June&ndash;26 June, 2025.</small> Summer school: “Exponential fields and valued fields in model theory”
	<p>Besides the invited speaker and the senior researchers, we will host PhD students and postdocs from Italy and from abroad.</p>
	</summary>
      <p>The
	scientific area of this summer school is model theory of exponential fields,
	and in particular it will focus on complex exponentiation, real exponen-
	tiation, differential fields and valued fields. The aim is to introduce the
	participants to some of the more recent developments and open problems
	in the area. The school targets PhD students and young researchers. The
	Summer School will consist of 4 short courses, taught by leading experts in
	the field, as well as one seminar talk by an invited researcher. Each course
	will include 4 lectures of 1 hour duration and problem sessions. There will
	also be problem sessions, which will be conducted by Postdocs chosen by
	the lecturers.
	The number of participants is expected to be around 45.

	    <small>14 July&ndash;18 July, 2025.</small> Final conference: “Model theory and tame
	    expansions of topological fields”.
	    <p>This meeting will close the thematic programme with a variety
	      of talks covering the main themes. A large model theory community actively participates in events organised around these
	      topics. </p>
      </summary>
      <p>
	This conference will target the main subject of this bimester: Model Theory
	and Tame Expansions of Topological Fields. Like the mini-workshop, the
	aim is to introduce the participants to some of the latest scientific develop-
	ments in the area, but also foster potential collaborations.
	We expect 80 to 100 participants.</p>
