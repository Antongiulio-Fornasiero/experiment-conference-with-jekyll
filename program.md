scientific area of this mini-workshop is recent developments in the model
theory of fields. The aim is to introduce the participants to some of the latest scientific developments in the area. The workshop targets PhD students
and young researchers, and will consist of 10 research talks by leading experts in the field, as well as some opportunities for early career researchers
to present posters and give contributed talks. Each research talk will be of
	    1 hour duration (including questions).
	  The number of participants is expected to be around 50.</p>

	  <p>The
scientific area of this summer school is model theory of exponential fields,
and in particular it will focus on complex exponentiation, real exponen-
tiation, differential fields and valued fields. The aim is to introduce the
participants to some of the more recent developments and open problems
 in the area. The school targets PhD students and young researchers. The
 Summer School will consist of 4 short courses, taught by leading experts in
the field, as well as one seminar talk by an invited researcher. Each course
will include 4 lectures of 1 hour duration and problem sessions. There will
also be problem sessions, which will be conducted by Postdocs chosen by
	  the lecturers.
	The number of participants is expected to be around 45.

This conference will target the main subject of this bimester: Model Theory
and Tame Expansions of Topological Fields. Like the mini-workshop, the
aim is to introduce the participants to some of the latest scientific develop-
ments in the area, but also foster potential collaborations.
We expect 80 to 100 participants.</p>
